This AI Risk Register provides a structured, enterprise grade approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across the AI lifecycle.  
It includes:
•	30 curated AI risks  
•	Scoring model (Impact × Likelihood × Detectability)  
•	RAG classification (Red/Amber/Green)  
•	MITRE ATLAS threat mappings  
•	Control recommendations  
•	Heatmap interpretation  
This risk register aligns to global frameworks:
•	NIST AI Risk Management Framework
•	ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management System
•	OECD AI Principles
•	MITRE ATLAS adversarial threat knowledge base
 Risk Scoring Model
  Risk Score = Impact × Likelihood × Detectability
 Impact: Severity of harm if the AI system fails.  
 Examples: discriminatory outcomes, safety incidents, legal violations.
 Likelihood:  Probability that the risk event occurs.  
 Includes: model drift, data quality issues, adversarial exploitation.
 Detectability:  How easily the issue can be detected.  
Low detectability = higher risk.
 RAG Rating: 
SCORE	RATING
40-100	High Risk (Red)
20-39	Medium Risk (Amber)
1-19	Low Risk (Green)

This register includes 9 major AI risk categories:
•	 Fairness & Bias Risk  
•	 Explainability Risk  
•	 Privacy & Data Protection Risk  
•	 Security Risk (MITRE ATLAS)  
•	 Performance & Reliability Risk  
•	 Ethical & Societal Risk  
•	 Compliance & Legal Risk  
•	 Operational Risk  
•	 Reputational Risk

 MITRE ATLAS Threat Mappings
 Each AI risk is mapped to real adversarial techniques, such as:
•	 AT1003 — Membership Inference
•	 AT1018 — Model Inversion
•	 AT1021 — Prompt Injection
•	 AT1005 — Data Poisoning
•	 AT1028 — Adversarial Input Manipulation
•	 AT1025 — Bias Exploitation
•	 AT1029 — Misuse of AI Capabilities
These mappings reflect “AI specific attack patterns” beyond traditional cybersecurity.

 Heatmap Dashboard 
A 5×5 matrix illustrates the distribution of AI risks across severity and probability        dimensions.
 X-axis: Likelihood (1–5)  
 Y-axis: Impact (1–5)  
 Colours represent:
   Red - High risk  
   Amber - Medium risk  
   Green - Low risk
